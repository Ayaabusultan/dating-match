### The **first** question is asking for the user name, and the user can't go therough the form if didn't enter the names

### The second question is to decide what gender he is intrested to date. and the user can't go through the form too if didnot answer the question

### The third question varies according to the answer of the second question.

### The user can't get the result if they did not answer every question in the form (sum of 6)

#### According to the answers, the website will show the user the first and the second celebrity match.

The website has a summation of 8 celebrities (4 males and 4 females) to give the results out of them.
